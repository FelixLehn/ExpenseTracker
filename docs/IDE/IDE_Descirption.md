# Descritpion of the IDE

For this Project I have used PyCharm. And this for the first time. 

Usually I used Visual Studio Code, because of the fast execution. But since I've got a new laptop with a better CPU and more RAM, I am about to get more fluent with PyCharm.
I also chose PyCharm because the project I worked on is completely written in Python. 

What I really like about PyCharm is, that you can easily set up a new project with a virtual environment. And of course the debugging of it is really great. 
Another point is the auto-fill-system of PyCharm. At first it was a little bit confusing to get used to these auto-fill system for the code, but since I worked for a couple of 
hours on that project, it has been gotten helpful. It saves a lot of time. 

My favourite Key-Shortcuts are: 

1. Strg + S: Save the current file 
2. Strg + /: Comment/Uncomment selected lines/code block 
3. Alt + STRG + I: Indent current line/selected block 
4. Strg + C: Copy 
5. Strg + V: Paste
6. Strg + X: Cut and copy 
7. Alt + Strg + L: Reformat Code
8. Shift + TAB: Unindent selected section
9. Shift + F9: Run Debugger
10. Shift + F10: Run Code
