# Functional Programming

In this file, 5 aspects of functional programming get explained by showing examples of the code. 

## Only final data structures
As the title implies, the data structures should be final. This means immutable. If you insert a variable in a function, the variable won't get rewritten or changed. It always creates a
new variable instead. An example of a final data strcuture is a tuple. 
An example of a final data strcuture in a function is also in the code:
